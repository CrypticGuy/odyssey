						Colosseum is the battle of bands competition that will be held in IIIT Delhi during its cultural fest, Odyssey. IIIT Delhi gets it that the most important thing for a band is to make their energy and presence felt. You want to make the crowd jump, rock to the tunes and sing along fervently. You want everyone to feel the music reach our soul. Bring out your riffs, shred off your solos, blast your rhythm and make the spectators ecstatic. The stage is all yours; now it’s on you to amaze Delhi with your performance and win the hearts of the people!
						<br><br>
						<span class="header">Rules:</span><br>
						
							<span class="rules--item">All bands must register on the registration form given on the Facebook Page and/or website to be eligible for participation.</span>
							<span class="rules--item">In the first round (online), all participating bands are expected to submit an audio/video submission of their performance of a song - either a cover of an existing song or an original song. The submission should be no shorter than 5 minutes and no longer than 15 minutes.</span>
							<span class="rules--item">In the second round (live), selected bands will be expected to perform an original composition. The band will get 30 minutes inclusive of setup and teardown.</span>
							<span class="rules--item">Repetition of any song in either of the rounds will lead to disqualification. Precisely, the song submitted for the online round will not be allowed for the live performance (if at all the band is selected). So if a band has only a single original song, then they are expected to perform that in the live round.</span>
							<span class="rules--item">The decision of the judges is final and binding.</span>

						We at IIIT Delhi would like to give artists a platform to fabricate music with the sounds generated only by the human body, be it vocalising, harmonising, tapping their feet, snapping their fingers or beat-boxing. Indian or western, language no bar, genre no bar. In A Cappella, the participants are members of an orchestra, in which they are the instrument, and they must use their voice and body in unison with those of others to stir the audience. There is music inside each one of us; the challenge is to let it out for the world to applaud.
