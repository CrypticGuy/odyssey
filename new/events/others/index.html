						At this year's edition of Odyssey - A Fantasy Saga, let us harbinger you to our debating event, which reintroduces itself through the extravaganza surrounding our much awaited cultural festival. Rather than unidirectionally extending your perspectives, we allow you to showcase your ability of making a surfaced argument from either side.

						We at IIIT believe that the essence of debating prevails in the language and intellectual honesty of the debaters, alongside the engagement of the listeners, which is why we’ll declare an Open House after all the speakers conclude to let everyone around rejoice in the true spirit of our event.

						<br><br>
						<span class="header">Rules:</span><br>
						<span class="rules--item">The event only allows individual participation.

						Students from any educational institute (school -classes 11th/12th/ college) across the country are allowed to enter, given they have a valid identity card.
						</span>
						<span class="rules--item">The event is strictly unilingual - all speeches have to be in English.
						Topics will be given on the spot and participants will have 10 minutes to prepare.
						</span>
						<span class="rules--item">Speaking time of 5 minutes will be given to the participants. They will start by arguing for the motion and reverse their stance after 2 minutes. The next 2 minutes involve their arguments against the motion following which the participants can summarize their views and give their opinion on the topic in the last minute.
						Adjudicator’s decision will be final and binding.

						 Mount your Cleansweeps. Zoom on your Firebolts. Its time for the greatest sport the wizarding world has ever seen: Quidditch played by muggles(nomags for the americans out there). Get ready to feel the adrenaline as the quaffle soars through the rings, the rush as you dodge the bludger by an inch and the elation as you catch the snitch. It doesn't matter if you are a beater, a seeker or to quote our favourite magizoologist "more of a chaser really", you have a place with us because Quidditch shall always be played at IIIT with those who ask for it.
					<br><br>
					<span class="header">Event Rules:</span>
					<span class="rules--item">The participants will have to play quidditch while either holding a broom or keeping a hand at their backs at all times. There will be 4 balls in play: one quaffle, two bludgers and one snitch. The quaffle in meant to be thrown by the chasers through the three hoops to score points. The beaters shoot the bludgers (a soft ball) using a bat at the opposing team’s chasers. Anyone hit with bludger must drop the ball that they may be carrying and run back to a ‘starting point’ which will be predecided. The keeper will save the goals and to give the keeper ease, the chasers must not cross a predecided area around the goal (like the D in football ) so that easy goals may not be shot. The snitch in the traditional rules present is an impartial person who runs around with a tennis ball but this may be changed later to make it more interesting for the players.

								The Chosen One promises to be a delight for Potterheads, making them relive the journey to the world of magic and beyond, with a completely new perspective!

								The goal of the second task would be to collect and destroy all horcruxes and defeat The Dark Lord. This round would primarily consist of 8 levels.
								In each of the first 7 levels, the teams would be supposed to complete 3 mind-boggling subtasks, on the basis of the clues provided. The subtasks would be as follows-
								Identifying the horcrux 
								Tracing its location
								Completing a challenge posed by the Death Eaters. (Beware! Unless the challenge is completed, a team cannot gain possession of the horcrux!)
