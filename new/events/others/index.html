						Colosseum is the battle of bands competition that will be held in IIIT Delhi during its cultural fest, Odyssey. IIIT Delhi gets it that the most important thing for a band is to make their energy and presence felt. You want to make the crowd jump, rock to the tunes and sing along fervently. You want everyone to feel the music reach our soul. Bring out your riffs, shred off your solos, blast your rhythm and make the spectators ecstatic. The stage is all yours; now it’s on you to amaze Delhi with your performance and win the hearts of the people!

						<span class="header">Rules:</span><br>
						<!-- All bands must register on the registration form given on the Facebook Page and/or website to be eligible for participation.
						In the first round (online), all participating bands are expected to submit an audio/video submission of their performance of a song - either a cover of an existing song or an original song. The submission should be no shorter than 5 minutes and no longer than 15 minutes.
						In the second round (live), selected bands will be expected to perform an original composition. The band will get 30 minutes inclusive of setup and teardown.
						Repetition of any song in either of the rounds will lead to disqualification. Precisely, the song submitted for the online round will not be allowed for the live performance (if at all the band is selected). So if a band has only a single original song, then they are expected to perform that in the live round. 
						The decision of the organising team and the judges will be final. -->

						We at IIIT Delhi would like to give artists a platform to fabricate music with the sounds generated only by the human body, be it vocalising, harmonising, tapping their feet, snapping their fingers or beat-boxing. Indian or western, language no bar, genre no bar. In A Cappella, the participants are members of an orchestra, in which they are the instrument, and they must use their voice and body in unison with those of others to stir the audience. There is music inside each one of us; the challenge is to let it out for the world to applaud.

						Tentative Rules:
						Each team shall consist of 3-25 members.
						5 minutes of set-up time and 10 minutes of performance time will be allocated to each team (without any carry over), exceeding which might lead to deduction of points.
						No back tracks are allowed. 
						Personal audio equipment is not allowed
						No instruments are allowed
						Cross-school or cross-college teams are allowed but information of the same must be given at the time of registering for the prelims.

						Description of Event:
						The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to muggles, The Dark Lord would himself mark him/her as his equal, but the 'Chosen One' will have a power the Dark Lord knows not, either must die at the hands of the other for neither can live while the other survives.

						The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will make himself known to the world as the month of January arrives..

						This is a prophecy by the Divination Professor of IIIT-D. Those who claim to be the 'CHOSEN ONE' will have to encounter a series of hardships to weed out The Death Eaters and destroy all horcruxes, to mark an end to the dark and terrible times muggles and wizards alike face.

						So come, test your destiny as we lead the surge against the dark forces to restore the lost peace of our world!


						Do keep an eye out on this page where our Divination Professor will regularly be making prophecies!!

						Event Structure:
						Enigma- The Chosen One promises to be a delight for Potterheads, making them relive the journey to the world of magic and beyond, with a completely new perspective! 

						The event structure would be the following-

						The first task would be a brain-storming session of OWLs (Ordinary Wizarding Level Exams), full of complex riddles and questions related to the Harry Potter world. The teams which score the maximum points would proceed towards the next task.

						The goal of the second task would be to collect and destroy all horcruxes and defeat The Dark Lord. This round would primarily consist of 8 levels.

						In each of the first 7 levels, the teams would be supposed to complete 3 mind-boggling subtasks, on the basis of the clues provided. The subtasks would be as follows-

						Identifying the horcrux 
						Tracing its location
						Completing a challenge posed by the Death Eaters. (Beware! Unless the challenge is completed, a team cannot gain possession of the horcrux!)

						4. Points would be allocated to each team on the basis of the tasks they complete.
						5. The second round of elimination would take place after the completion of Level 4. 
						6. The last level would be a surprise task and revealed on the spot.
						7. The team with the maximum score at the end would be declared as ‘The Chosen One’ and would win!

						ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: NONE
						TEAM SIZE: 3-4 
						EVENT DURATION: 2 days

						Event Rules

						Each team should consist of 3-4 members.
						This event is open to all. Cross-college and cross-school teams are allowed. Multiple teams from a college/school are allowed.
